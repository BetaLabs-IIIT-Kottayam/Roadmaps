# App Development Roadmap

> **Note:** If you already have an understanding of programming fundamentals and core development concepts, you can skip to Step 6: Frameworks.

## Step 1: Learn Programming Concepts

* Understand the working and usage of commonly used data structures like lists, dictionaries (maps), tuples, arrays, sets, etc.
* Learn Object-Oriented Programming Concepts like classes, functions, objects, etc.

### Resources
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
* [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) (More detailed)

You will have cleared Step 1 if you completely learn any one Object-Oriented Programming Language (Python, Java, Dart).

## Step 2: Understanding How the Internet Works

### Learn Basic Networking Concepts
* HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, IP addresses, client-server model.

### Understand APIs
* RESTful APIs, making requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), JSON.

### Understand Frontend-Backend (Client/Server) Interaction
* Data flow between servers and clients.

### Understand Security Basics
* Encryption, authentication, secure communication.

### Resources
* [MDN Web Docs: HTTP Overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview) 
* [How the Internet Works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/How_does_the_Internet_work) 

## Step 3: Understanding Databases

### Core Concepts:
* What is a database?
* Difference between relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases.
* CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete.

### SQL Basics:
* Learn queries for relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOINs, and basic subqueries.

### NoSQL Basics:
* Explore NoSQL databases like Firebase Firestore or MongoDB.
* Understand collections and documents.

### Resources
* [SQL: W3Schools SQL Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) 
* [Firebase Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs) 

> For Step 2 and 3, you don't have to be thorough; you just need to have an idea of how things work.

## Step 4: Understanding Frameworks

1. Learn about frameworks and how they simplify development.
2. Native Development:
   * iOS Development: Use Swift or Objective-C and tools like XCode.
   * Android Development: Use Kotlin or Java and Android Studio.
3. Cross-Platform Development:
   * Flutter (Dart): Google's framework for building natively compiled apps for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
   * React Native (JavaScript): Create apps with native performance using JavaScript.
   * Xamarin (C#): A Microsoft framework for creating cross-platform apps with .NET.
   * Ionic (JavaScript): Leverages web technologies to build hybrid apps.
4. Pros and Cons:
   * Native apps provide high performance and better platform-specific capabilities.
   * Cross-platform apps save development time and cost by reusing code for multiple platforms.

* [React Native Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) 

## Step 5: Learn Version Control
* Learn how to use Git and GitHub.

### Resources
* [Git Tutorial for Dummies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ-qvsxPHpY&t=72s&ab_channel=NickWhite) 
* [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) 

## Step 6: Flutter Roadmap

* [Flutter Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/flutter)

### Flutter Setup

Visit Flutter's official Documentation for all and any information related to Flutter:
* [Flutter Official Docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/) 

### Flutter Installation
1. Visit the installation guide for platform-specific instructions (Windows, macOS, Linux).
2. After selecting your platform, you will be asked to select your first type of App. Select Android.
3. Follow the instructions there to set up Flutter.

### Flutter Installation (Alternative):
* Go to [Flutter Course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/?couponCode=LEARNNOWPLANS) 
* Scroll down and click on Windows Setup or MacOS setup.
* Follow the video instructions.

> **Tip:** The videos in the introduction module are free, so you can watch them to get a basic idea of Flutter as well as set up your environment for Flutter. (And the same is true for most Udemy Courses.)

*P.S. I'm not promoting Udemy; it just happens to be the course I used to learn Flutter, and it's really nice.*
